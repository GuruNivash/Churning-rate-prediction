Recently, a bank with millions of customers has noticed unusual amount of customers leaving the bank. To make sure that this negative development will be stopped on
time, the bank first needs to identify the customers who have high likelihood to churn. Identifying these customers will help the bank also to avoid repeating the same mistakes with the rest of the customers and avoid them leaving the bank from the early stages. The aim is to predict the churning rate of the customers from the bank. We will use customerâ€™s characteristics to determine his/her probability of leaving the bank. Popular Python libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras and Machine Learning techniques such as Adam Optimizer are used to train the ANN model and predict the churn rates.
